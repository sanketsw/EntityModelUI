	The story begins as Don Vito Corleone, the head of a New York Mafia
	family, overseeshis daughter's wedding. His beloved son ichael has just
	come home from the war, but does not intend to become part of his
	father's business. T hrough Michael's life the nature of the family
	business becomes clear. The business of the family is just like the
	head of the family, kind and benevolent to those who give respect, but
	given to ruthless violence whenever anything stands against the good of
	the family. </p-accordionTab> <p-accordionTab header="Godfather II Primeng-accordion">
	Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his
	landmark 1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's
	rise with his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's
	depiction of the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s,
	the child Vito flees his Sicilian village for America after the local
	Mafia kills his family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or
	illegally, for his wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the
	local Black Hand Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the
	tyro's business. With Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows. </p-accordionTab> <p-accordionTab
		header="Godfather III Primeng-accordion"> After a
	break of more than 15 years, director Francis Ford Coppola and writer
	Mario Puzo returned to the well for this third and final story of the
	fictional Corleone crime family. Two decades have passed, and crime
	kingpin Michael Corleone, now divorced from his wife Kay has nearly
	succeeded in keeping his promise that his family would one day be
	completely legitimate. </p-accordionTab> </p-accordion>
